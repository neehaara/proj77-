        <h1>About VSC</h1>
        <p>
            VSC stands for Visual Studio Code. I just started to code on this platform a day ago so I dont know much.
            From what I know (I know only 2 things) The two thing I know are.. how to create variable
<br>
<br>
            var (name variable)="type something..";
<br>
<br>
            The 2nd thing I know is how to print(make it visble on screen) your 'something' that you wrote in the variable. Here's how
<br>
<br>
            console.log(variable name);
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh, and there's an extra thing I know too!
            I have actually done a lot of variable making and printing on this site. You just cant see it. Or Can you?
            You can.
            All you have to do is right-click on a website, click inspect and go to console. And there, you see it! Try it out on this website, right now!

        <script>
            var first_name="Kylie";
            console.log(first_name);
            var last_name=" Jenner";
            console.log(last_name);
            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);
        
            var name_1="i am Kylie Jenner";
            console.log(name_1);
            var replace=name_1.replace("Kylie","Kendall");
            console.log(replace);
        
            var a=25;
            console.log(a);
            var b=5
            console.log(b);
            var add=a + b;
            console.log(add);
            var sub=a - b;
            console.log(sub);
            var multi=a * b;
            console.log(multi);
            var div=a / b;
            console.log(div);
        
            var max_num=Math.max(29,58);
            console.log(max_num);
        
            var min_num=Math.min(69,96);
            console.log(min_num);
